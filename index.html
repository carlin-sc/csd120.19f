            <h1>Welcome to Carlin' CSD120 Website! </h1> 
                  <p> 
                     I am currently a student at Sault College! and I'm planning on finishing my two years of Computer Programming <br>
                     so I could be one step closer to obtaining a Computer Science Degree. In past experiences, I have worked as I.T <br>
                     at my local schools in my hometown for a Summer of work and 2 separate classes in Co-Op for school. <br>
                     <br>
                     On my freetime, I like to help out at home and be busy. My usual pass times consist of playing games, movies and reading.<br>
                     My hometown is in Moose Factory which is way up North of Ontario and I have decided to come live in Sault Ste Marie for my <br>
                     chosen place of education. I have also lived in Quebec for six months and went for a visit in the London, UK.
